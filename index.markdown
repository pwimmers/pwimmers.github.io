Hello, I am a passionate engineering manager and software engineer from *Düsseldorf, Germany*.

I possess over 15 years of experience in designing, implementing, and managing high-scale web applications both on-premise and in the cloud. 

In the past 5+ years, I’ve focused on leading diverse engineering teams, driving strategic goals, and fostering professional development. 

My technical expertise spans backend development, agile practices, and DevOps, while my leadership roles have involved guiding teams through complex projects, recruiting top talent, and supporting cross-functional collaboration. 

Currently I am working at [Aiven](https://aiven.io) as an Software Engineering Manager for a team of 10 (backend, frontend and full stack engineers).

Outside work, I enjoy hiking, climbing, cooking, home automation, movies, series, and exploring new technologies.
